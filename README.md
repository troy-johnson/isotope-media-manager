# Isotope Media Manager
Isotope Media Manager is designed to assist the user in keeping track of the media they own in a searchable, visual format. Currently, Isotope supports the following media types:
- Movies
- TV Shows

Support will be added in the future for the following media types:
- Music (CDs, MP3s, vinyl, etc.)
- Books (hardback, paperback, e-books, etc.)
- Other (magazines, etc.)

## To Do
The following features are planned to be added to the app (subject to change).

- User Registration: Currently, this app is designed for use by one user. We will be adding support for user registration so others can track their collections and manage their own profile.
- Search: Users will be able to search by title, cast, etc.
- [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en)/[IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/) Integration: Users will be able to add titles existing on TMDb or IMDb to their collection by searching for titles by name, cast, year released, etc.
